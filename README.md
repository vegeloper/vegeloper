Who Says Tech Folks Can't Support Vegans❓🌎
I’m Khashi, a full stack web developer. Would you like reading more about me? Number 3 is inspiring.

#1 💖 I will soon be immigrating to the evergreen Canada and will join my beloved ones.
When I’m not creating new projects, you can find me meditating, on a walk with my wife, or immersed in a French nocturne on my piano.

#2 💪 I am obsessed with setting the bar higher and higher, and it makes me more passionate to render the most engaging and creative version of my work. I help my team in simplifying complex projects into manageable chunks and simple tasks so that we can easily outperform our rivals.

#3 💡 A few years ago, I attended an advanced physics programme at CERN, the world's biggest laboratory and the birthplace of the Internet. There I learnt the human capacity for going above and beyond is truly astonishing. The experience of getting an insider's look at the pioneering scientific endeavour of our time had such a revolutionary impact on my life that soon completely restructured it. Right after, I started to gradually develop a more productive, meaningful and inclusive lifestyle, So I later became a VegeLoper !!!

#4 🛠️ I tend to follow the tech community's best practices and use its best-in-class tools and services. On sunny Amazon-powered days, I absolutely love walking on Google clouds, swimming in the Digital Ocean, and reading Facebook from cover to Doker. At nights, I enjoy watching "Vanilla JavaScript" magic shows, where she Reacts to her avid fans and magically appears an Express server under her fancy Node dress!

I am always pleased to help you with:
▸ Building responsive web apps from scratch (Frontend/Backend)
▸ Prototyping engaging User experience (Figma/AdobeXD)
▸ Developing RESTful/GraphQL APIs (Express/Apollo)
▸ Managing SQL/NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL/Redis)
▸ Securing Backend/Frontend using authentication methods (Passport.js/Firebase)

▸ Deployment to IaaS (AWS/GCP/Heroku)
